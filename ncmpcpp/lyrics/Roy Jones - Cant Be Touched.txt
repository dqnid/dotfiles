[Chorus]
Can't be touched
Can't be stopped
Can't be moved
Can't be rocked
Can't be shook
We hot
When will you niggas learn

Came to get crunk
Came to bring life
Came to get it started
Came to get it right
Turn down your music
Turn up my mic
When will you niggas learn

[Verse 1: Magic]
I mean what I speak, I do as I say
I hustle I grind, don't get in my way
I'm pimpin' my hoes, I'm jackin' my flows
I spit at police and duck my P.O.'s
I ain't goin' to court, you can call a judge
Tell him kiss my ass, cause I ain't gon' budge
And I ain't goin' back to lock up
You tryin' to glock a pop up
I ain't goin' back to both
And I'm never gonna stop the puffin', not for nothin'
The block they need me, the streets they need me
The club scene nigga, is mine believe me
You don't believe me

[Chorus:]
Can't be touched
Can't be stopped
Can't be moved
Can't be rocked
Can't be shook
We hot
When will you niggas learn

Came to get crunk
Came to bring life
Came to get it started
Came to get it right
Turn down your music
Turn up my mic
When will you niggas learn

[Verse 2: Trouble]
Open your hearts for me, look what I got for you
You in the presence of greatness, I'll make it hot for you
Pass the rock to me, block and I'll run with it
Here for the game and all the pussy that come with it
So full of focus I'm insistent on keepin' it goin'
The Franchise, I exist in a league of my own
Expect attention unfamiliar with being ignored
The truth back, can't it lockin' and closin' the doors
Brick wall in the road, I won't move
The King I'm like Roy, in the ring I can't lose
Show the face of what compares to mine
You wanna war, mutha fucka I ain't hard to find
Now holla back, nigga

[Chorus:]
Can't be touched
Can't be stopped
Can't be moved
Can't be rocked
Can't be shook
We hot
When will you niggas learn

Came to get crunk
Came to bring life
Came to get it started
Came to get it right
Turn down your music
Turn up my mic
When will you niggas learn

[Verse 3: Roy Jones, Jr.]
I move when my heart say move
Fierce like a lion, got nothin' to prove
Stubborn as a hot damn mule
God in my corner, nigga can't lose
Tryin' to take me out my hot damn shoes
See how quick I jump up and give you bitches the blues
They gonna see you on the hot damn news
And that ain't even nothin', linkin' me to the crime
Not a print, not a hot damn clue
Beatin' these niggas down is what I came to do
And I ain't playin' by a hot damn rule
Shakin' you niggas down if you ain't payin' your dues
We passin' up your block and ooohh! (Gun Shot)
My screws are loose, don't call my hands
Cause you gon' make me act a hot damn fool
Dead discussion, you will not win cause I will not lose

[Chorus:]
Can't be touched
Can't be stopped
Can't be moved
Can't be rocked
Can't be shook
We hot
When will you niggas learn

Came to get crunk
Came to bring life
Came to get it started
Came to get it right
Turn down your music
Turn up my mic
When will you niggas learn
