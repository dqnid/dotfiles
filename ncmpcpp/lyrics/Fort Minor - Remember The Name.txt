You ready?! Lets go!
Yeah, for those of you that want to know what we're all about
It's like this y'all (c'mon!)

[Chorus]
This is 10 percent luck, 20 percent skill
15 percent concentrated power of will
5 percent pleasure, 50 percent pain
And 100 percent reason to remember the name

[ Fort Minor ]
Mike
He doesn't need his name up in lights
He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic
He feels so unlike everybody else, alone
In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him
But no, he knows the code
It's not about the salary
It's all about reality and making some noise
Makin the story - makin sure his clique stays up
That means when he puts it down Tak's pickin it up! let's go!

[ Styles of Beyond ]
Who the hell is he anyway?
He never really talks much
Never concerned with status but still leavin them star struck
Humbled through opportunities given to him despite the fact
That many misjudge him 'cause he makes a livin from writin raps
Put it together himself, now the picture connects
Never askin for someone's help, to get some respect
He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach
And now when it all unfolds, the skill of an artist

[ Raiyu ]
It's just twenty percent skill
Eighty percent fear be a hundred percent clear cause Raiyu is ill
Who would've thought that he'd be the one that set the west in flames
Then I heard him wreckin with The Crystal Method, "Name Of The Game"
Came back, dropped Megadeth, took em to church
I like bleach man, why you have the stupidest verse?
This dude is the truth, now everybody givin him guest spots
His stock's through the roof I heard he f**kin with S. Dot!

[Chorus]
This is 10 percent luck, 20 percent skill
15 percent concentrated power of will
5 percent pleasure, 50 percent pain

And 100 percent reason to remember the name

[ Ryu ]
They call him Ryu The Sick
And he's spittin fire with Mike
Got him out the dryer he's hot
Found him in Fort Minor with Tak
Been a f**kin anihilist porcupine
He's a p____, he's a c___, the type women wanna be with, and rappers hope he get shot
Eight years in the makin, patiently waitin to blow
Now the record with Shinoda's takin over the globe
He's got a partner in crime, his s___ is equally dope
You wont believe the kind of s___ that comes out of this kid's throat

[ Styles of Beyond ]
Tak!
He's not your everyday on the block
He knows how to work with what he's got
Makin his way to the top
People think its a common owners name
People keep askin him was it given at birth
Or does it stand for an acronym. No
He's livin proof, Got him rockin the booth
He'll get you buzzin quicker than a shot of vodka with juice
Him and his crew are known around as one of the best
Dedicated to what they do and give a hundred percent

[ Fort Minor ]
Forget Mike - Nobody really knows how or why he works so hard
It seems like he's never got time
Because he, writes every note and he writes every line
And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind
It's like a design is written in his head every time
Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme
And those motherf**kers he runs with, those kids that he signed?
Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?!

[Chorus]
This is 10 percent luck, 20 percent skill
15 percent concentrated power of will
5 percent pleasure, 50 percent pain
And 100 percent reason to remember the name

[Outro - Mike Shinoda]
Yeah! Fort Minor
M. Shinoda - Styles of Beyond
Ryu! Takbir! Machine Shop!
